In this week i've gotten to lnow a little bit more about Problems for fast functions. Whats needed ive realized that you dont
always receive 3 things for the domain. For the expression ":name; number string string->image". In the test we took this week 
im pretty sure i didnt do good. I needed the extra help from today and to better understand what these things really meant.Im 
not confused at all on what they do. what i give the computer i must receive what I gave. Better understanding of these expressions
which are "(EXAMPLE(gt 20))(triangle 20 "solid""green"))
