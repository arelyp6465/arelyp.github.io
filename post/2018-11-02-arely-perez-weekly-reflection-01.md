The Introduction to function definition would be mentioned throughout this week. Well durig this weeks cumputer class i have gained to learn more about how expressions care so much about order. Contracts whatever you give to the computer its what you will receive. An example would be (big-star "purple") the reason why this codse wouldnt work its because they dont have the size and they dont have the string. Size meaning number, string meaning "the outline" or you want it "solid". A way better expression would be (star 100 "outline""purple"). since it would be showing how big the star is and the color. Not only did I order matters a lot in code.
