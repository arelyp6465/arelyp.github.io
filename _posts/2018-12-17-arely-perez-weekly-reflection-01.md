In the beginning of my program. I'd struggle to perform the right code for this lesson. At first I used put-image and found my way throughout it and accomplished to finish. Than I would try define whatever you want to define or show in your program. i would stack up on shapes to make my flag first. I would fix where my shapes would go. Making sure they have the same color and about a similar shape. I'd introduce to you the flag tunisia. I made 2 circles and one white than one red to try to make a crescent. Its important to getit accurate cause its something that would capture peoples eyes. Last but not least you would define the star into the program. Were doing layers to accomplish this task.
