I've managed to learn a lot in these past few weeks; I created my own website and here I am blogging about my understanding based on computer science. Well you can say we began to understand "The Language", Racket From Scheme Language. Order matters! ive been told. Expressions became a topic you have to apply the order to evaluate expressions. Parenthesis make thge order of expressions more clear. In the beginning of october the introduction had been "contracts". Its where your giving the computer what it expects getting back what you expect(look at example 2).


















Example 2: 
;star:number string string --> image
