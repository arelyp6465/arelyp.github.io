The defintions you will be learning today are "Apply Evaluate Expression" . Evsluate the order to evaluate expressions. An example
you would be able to use is 8 * 5 . You are able to evaluate the expression. Its a mathmatical expression sentence it can be evaluated. Parenthesis make the order of expressions more clear and would keep in the function. So the differences of a value and a function is the a value doesnt change while a function just produces.(Function is a verb and A Value is a noun). So our example was 8*5 and the things I learned that I would do is that I would place them in a circle and put the function on top and the numbers on the inside its the numbers and you would go inside and end up with (* 8 5), 40.
